# Untitiled Cat Game



## About
Game about a cat that was minding its own business, when suddenly monsters started attacking!!!!! Luckily, every 10 seconds the cat can pick a friend with a random powerup (but so do the enemies...)

## Controls
**Point** and **click** (or **hold**) to shoot at the baddies.
**WASD** to move around the map.
**Escape** for when you inevitably fall off the map.

## Enemy Types
### Blossom 
A machine gunner flower. Will shoot you 100 times a second for fun. Fortunately immobile as hell, and those bullets don't do too much.  
### Fire Dragon
Fairly standard, with a higher HP. Not much to write home about. Will happily function as a home heater for UK based players this winter.  
### Snake
Sneaky, Slow and Strong. Strongest individual attacks, but very weak defensively. Slightly harder to hit due to their small size.  
### Wolf
Woof. Woof Woof. Woof? (Most mobile foe. Can't attack often).
